Registering a website name (domain name e.g. mywebsite.com) costs a subscription that varies depending on your
choice of a suffix for your website's name (e.g. .co, .com, .tech, .space).

To keep your website on the internet, you need to put your website on a computer with a 24/7
internet connection that will display your website to users whenever they visit your newly
registered domain name (meaning you need to host your website), this also costs a subscription.

The domain name subscription price and the hosting subscription price are not part of
the price it will cost WebBuildHQ to build the website for you.

To figure out the price it will cost to register your website name (domain name registration) and
the price it will take to host your website, {whatsapp} WebBuildHQ with your required domain
name (e.g. mywebapp.com) to check the prices for you  or visit *hostinger.com* to check for the
domain and hosting (check for VPS hosting) prices personally.


    Designs

You can either choose to make a website from scratch, fully customized (for example, this website you are
currently on https://webbuildhq.space/ started out as a blank page and was customized fully up to the
point it is at now by WebBuildHQ) or you can choose a ready-made template from the {designs} listed on this page,
customized templates give you full control of how you want your website to look and are more expensive, while
ready-made templates are faster to develop and are cheaper, both choices are good.

Choose a template from the following:
